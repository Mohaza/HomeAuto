# HomeAuto Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.

HomeAuto simulates a real-time application that will display temperature and humidity of all the rooms of a specified house. 
Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for the application to start. To access the different houses, it is important to type which house in the URL. For ex. house1 will be accessed through navigating to `http://localhost:4200/homes/house1/data`. Currently there is five houses in the mock-data, from `house1` to `house5`.
